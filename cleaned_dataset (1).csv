--> Key Insights
🔹 Movies dominate the platform, making up 86% of total content, but shows are preferred by viewers. The strategy should focus on increasing TV shows while producing only the most popular movie genres.
🎭 Drama is the most common genre, but users prefer multi-genre content. The platform should diversify content themes to boost engagement.
🌍 The USA & India produce over 60% of the platform’s content. Partnering with other high-rated production countries like Japan can improve quality.
